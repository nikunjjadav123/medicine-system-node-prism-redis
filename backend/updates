1) Add Jai Validation in Registration / Login
2) use winston for logging
3) Error Middleware

Modification after Deployment : set MONGO_LOCAL_URL to MONGO_ATLAS_PRODUCTION_URL


===> For Logout
JWT is stateless

That means:

Server does NOT store JWT

Server only verifies JWT using secret

So once a token is created:

It stays valid until it expires

Server cannot “delete” it normally

=> So we have stored the current token into blacklist
